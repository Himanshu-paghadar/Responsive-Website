      <p class="europe-details text-small">
        <li>Europe is a continent[a] comprising the westernmost peninsulas of Eurasia, located entirely in the Northern
          Hemisphere and mostly in the Eastern Hemisphere. It shares the continental landmass of Afro-Eurasia with both
          Africa and Asia. It is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, the
          Mediterranean Sea to the south, and Asia to the east. Europe is commonly considered to be separated from Asia
          by the watershed of the Ural Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian Sea, the Greater Caucasus, the Black Sea
          and the waterways of the Turkish Straits.</li><br>
          <li>
            Europe covers about 10.18 million km2 (3.93 million sq mi), or 2% of Earth's surface (6.8% of land area),
          making it the second-smallest continent (using the seven-continent model). Politically, Europe is divided into
          about fifty sovereign states, of which Russia is the largest and most populous, spanning 39% of the continent
          and comprising 15% of its population. Europe had a total population of about 745 million (about 10% of the
          world population) in 2021. The European climate is largely affected by warm Atlantic currents that temper
          winters and summers on much of the continent, even at latitudes along which the climate in Asia and North
          America is severe. Further from the sea, seasonal differences are more noticeable than close to the coast.

        <li>The United States of America (U.S.A. or USA), commonly known as the United States (U.S. or US) or America,
          is a country primarily located in North America. It consists of 50 states, a federal district, five major
          unincorporated territories, nine Minor Outlying Islands, and 326 Indian reservations. The United States is the
          world's third-largest country by both land and total area. It shares land borders with Canada to its north and
          with Mexico to its south and has maritime borders with the Bahamas, Cuba, Russia, and other nations. With a
          population of over 333 million,it is the most populous country in the Americas and the third most populous in
          the world. The national capital of the United States is Washington, D.C., and its most populous city and
          principal financial center is New York City.</li><br>
        <li>
          By 1900, the United States had established itself as a world power, becoming the world's largest economy.
          After Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941, the U.S. entered World War II on the Allied side. The aftermath
          of the war left the United States and the Soviet Union as the world's two superpowers and led to the Cold War.
          During the Cold War, both countries engaged in a struggle for ideological dominance but avoided direct
          military conflict. They also competed in the Space Race, which culminated in the 1969 landing of Apollo 11,
          making the U.S. the first and only nation to ever land humans on the Moon. With the Soviet Union's collapse
          and the subsequent end of the Cold War in 1991, the United States emerged as the world's sole superpower.</li>

        <li>Asia is the largest continent in the world by both land area and population. It covers an area of more than
          44 million square kilometers, about 30% of Earth's total land area and 8% of Earth's total surface area. The
          continent, which has long been home to the majority of the human population, was the site of many of the first
          civilizations. Its 4.7 billion people constitute roughly 60% of the world's population, having more people
          than all other continents combined.</li><br>
